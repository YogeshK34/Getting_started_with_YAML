# Getting_started_with_YAML
So i just came to know about YAML,it's a markup language used to store data configurations in human readable format
The data we store in YAML file is called as Data Serialization (a process of converting data objects into a complex data structure or we can also say stream of bytes)
So basically we have a serializer who serializes object into streams of bytes into (a): to store object into YAML file (b):to store object into database (c):to store object 
into memory
Similar to serialization we have also perform deserialization (to convert this streams of byte back into the object which contains code/data)
