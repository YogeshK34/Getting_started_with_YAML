So we all know that in yaml we write code in human readable format below mentioned are some examples of code
#YAML has key value pairs,each key has a value for ex:
          Say my name : You're Heisenberg
in this 'say is the key' and value to the key is 'you're heisenberg
key value pairs are seperated by a colon ':'
we can also write yaml code in various styles such as block style: 
 address:
   - 303,Negro-Arroyo,Lane
   - Albuqurque
   - New-Mexico
in block style you have to make sure that the items mentioned must be indented or else program will give you an error

characters:
 - Tyrion
 - Jon
 - Hound
 - Jaime
---
places:
 - King's landing
 - Wall
 - Fighting pit
 - Winterfell
---
battles: 
 - Blackwater
 - Basterds
 - Hardhome
 - Castle black 
 ...

to end the code you simply write ...
